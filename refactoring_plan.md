# EXPATH - Refactoring Suggestions

## 1. `lib/main.dart`

*   **Dependency Injection:** Implement dependency injection via Riverpod, but not with code generation. This will help manage dependencies more cleanly and make testing easier. Use Providers to inject dependencies where needed, such as the `FileSystem` and `RuleManager`.
*   **State Management:** The current state management appears to be handled with `ChangeNotifier`. For a more robust and scalable solution, migrate to `riverpod`. This would provide a clearer separation of concerns and make the state easier to manage as the application grows. Do not use StateProviders or something like this, but always use NotifierProviders or AsyncNotifierProviders.

## 2. `lib/gui/main_screen/main_screen.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Widget Refactoring:** The `MainScreen` widget is quite large. Break it down into smaller, more manageable widgets.
  * "Directory related buttons" -> DirectoyButtonsRow
  * "Rules related buttons" -> RulesButtonsRow
* Better differentiate between rules (Regel) und rule stacks (Regelstapel) in the UI. Use consistent naming conventions to avoid confusion.
*   **State Management:** The logic for adding directories and managing rule stacks is tightly coupled with the UI. Move this logic to a Riverpod Notifier to separate concerns and improve testability.
*   **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block in the `_addDirectory` method is quite generic. Implement more specific error handling and provide user-friendly feedback if a directory cannot be accessed.

---
## 3. `lib/gui/main_screen/_widgets/directories_list.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **UI/Logic Separation:** The widget is responsible for both displaying the list of directories and handling the logic for removing them. Use the approriate Notifier.
*   **Component-Based Design:** Create a custom `DirectoryListItem` widget to encapsulate the layout and behavior of each item. This would make the code cleaner and more reusable.
*   **User Feedback:** When a directory is removed, provide a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions. A simple `AlertDialog` would be sufficient.

---
## 4. `lib/gui/main_screen/_widgets/rules_list.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **State Management:** Similar to the `DirectoriesList`, the logic for adding, removing, and reordering rule stacks should be moved to a Notifier.
*   **Code Duplication:** The `_onReorder` method is quite complex. This could be simplified by using a more declarative approach with a state management library.
*   **Clarity and Naming:** The `fold` method used to display the rule types can be difficult to read. Consider creating a helper method with a more descriptive name to generate this string.
*   **Null Safety:** The code has a potential null access issue (`next.ruleType.label`). While this might be handled by the current logic, it's better to use null-safe operators (`?.` or `!`) to make the code more robust.

---
## 5. `lib/gui/preview_screen/preview_screen.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Data Flow:** The `PreviewScreen` receives the `rootDirectoryEntries` and `ruleStacks` as arguments. This is a good start, but for a more scalable solution, use Riverpod to provide these dependencies.
*   **UI Refactoring:** The `Scaffold` and `AppBar` are standard, but the body of the widget could be broken down into smaller components. The `PreviewTable` is already a separate widget, which is good practice.
  * Extract the scrolling logic into a seperate widget, e.g. 'BidirectionalScrollView'.
*   **Loading and Empty States:** The widget currently displays a `CircularProgressIndicator` while loading. Consider adding a more user-friendly loading indicator and a clear "empty state" message if there is no data to preview.

---
## 6. `lib/gui/preview_screen/_widgets/preview_table.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Code Clarity:** The nested loops in `_generatePreviewData` can be difficult to follow. Consider refactoring this logic into smaller, more focused methods with descriptive names.
*   **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block in the `apply` method is very broad. Implement more specific error handling to identify which rule is causing an issue and provide more informative feedback to the user.

---
## 7. `lib/gui/rule_editor_screen/rule_editor_screen.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Widget Complexity:** The `RuleEditorScreen` is a very large and complex widget. It should be broken down into several smaller widgets. For example, the `_buildEingabe` method could be extracted into a dedicated `RuleInputWidget`.
*   **State Management:** The screen manages a lot of state, including the `ruleStack`, the `textEditingControllers`, and the `validation` map. This state should be moved to a dedicated state management class to simplify the widget and improve testability.
*   **Dynamic Rule Forms:** The `_buildEingabe` method uses a series of `if` statements to build the form for each rule type. This could be refactored into a more dynamic system, where each `Rule` class is responsible for providing its own configuration UI.
*   **Validation Logic:** The validation logic is tightly coupled with the UI. This should be moved to the `Eingabe` model itself.
*   **Null Safety:** The code has a potential null access issue (`e.label`). Use null-safe operators (`?.` or `!`) to make the code more robust.

---
## 8. `lib/logic/excel/excel_exporter.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Error Handling:** The `export` method has a broad `try-catch` block. Implement more specific error handling to catch potential issues with file permissions, invalid data, or Excel library errors.
*   **Code Structure:** The class is well-focused, but the `export` method is quite long. It could be broken down into smaller, private methods for clarity (e.g., `_createHeaderRow`, `_populateDataRows`).
*   **File Saving:** The method for saving the file is platform-specific. While this is necessary, consider creating a dedicated `FileSaver` service to abstract away the platform differences and make the code cleaner.

---
## 9. `lib/logic/filesystem/pathfinder.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Asynchronous Operations:** The `getAllFiles` method uses `listSync`, which can block the UI thread if the directory is very large. Use the asynchronous version, `list`, and `await` the results to keep the UI responsive.
*   **Error Handling:** The method should include `try-catch` blocks to handle potential `FileSystemException` errors, such as when a directory is not found or cannot be accessed due to permissions.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The `Pathfinder` class is well-focused on its task. No major refactoring is needed here, but ensure it is used within a background isolate for large operations.

---
## 10. `lib/logic/filesystem/root_directory_entry.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Immutability:** The `RootDirectoryEntry` class is a simple data model. Consider making it immutable by declaring its fields as `final` and using a constructor to initialize them. This can help prevent unintended side effects.
*   **Code Clarity:** The class is well-named and its purpose is clear. No major refactoring is needed.

---
## 11. `lib/logic/filesystem/save_load.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Error Handling:** The `saveRuleStacksToJson` and `loadRuleStacksFromJson` methods should include `try-catch` blocks to handle potential `FileSystemException` errors (e.g., file not found, permission denied) and `FormatException` errors if the JSON is malformed.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** The file I/O operations are asynchronous, which is good. However, ensure that they are called from a context that can handle the `Future` (e.g., using `await` in an `async` method).
*   **User Feedback:** When an error occurs during saving or loading, provide clear feedback to the user. A simple dialog or a snackbar would be appropriate.
*   **Null Safety:** The code has a potential null access issue (`r.toJson()`). Use null-safe operators (`?.` or `!`) to make the code more robust.

---
## 12. `lib/logic/rules/_eingabe.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Immutability:** The `Eingabe` class is a data model. Consider making it immutable by declaring its fields as `final` and using a constructor to initialize them. This would make the code more predictable and prevent unintended side effects.
*   **Validation:** The validation logic is currently handled in the `RuleEditorScreen`. Consider moving the validation logic into the `Eingabe` class itself, or to a dedicated validator class. This would improve the separation of concerns.
*   **Clarity:** The name `Eingabe` is German for "input." While this is consistent with the rest of the codebase, consider renaming it to `RuleInput` or something similar for better clarity in an English-language context.

---
## 13. `lib/logic/rules/_rule.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Factory Constructor:** The `RuleType` enum could be extended to include the `fromJson` constructor directly, which would make the `switch` statement even cleaner.
*   **Abstract Class Design:** The `Rule` class is a good example of an abstract class. It defines a clear contract for all rule implementations. No major refactoring is needed here.
*   **Error Handling:** The `fromJson` factory should include a `default` case in the `switch` statement to handle unknown rule types and throw a `FormatException` to prevent crashes.

---
## 14. `lib/logic/rules/_rule_type.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Enum Enhancement:** The `RuleType` enum is well-structured. It could be enhanced by moving the `label` and `constructor` directly into the enum definition, which is a feature supported by Dart. This would make the code more self-contained.
*   **`fromJson` in Enum:** As mentioned in the `_rule.dart` section, the `fromJson` constructor could also be moved into the enum definition. This would centralize the logic for creating rules from JSON.
*   **Clarity:** The `fromType` method is essentially a reverse lookup. Consider renaming it to `fromLabel` or `fromString` for better clarity.

---
## 15. Concrete Rule Implementations

This section covers all the concrete rule implementation files in `lib/logic/rules/`.

Files included:
*   `concatenation_rule.dart`
*   `conditional_rule.dart`
*   `created_at_rule.dart`
*   `file_path_rule.dart`
*   `file_size_rule.dart`
*   `file_type_rule.dart`
*   `lower_upper_case_rule.dart`
*   `path_segment_rule.dart`
*   `reverse_path_segment.dart`
*   `simple_regex_rule.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Code Duplication:** There is a lot of duplicated code across the rule implementations, especially in the `toJson` and `fromJson` methods. See above for how to change it.
*   **Immutability:** The rule classes should be immutable. Declare all fields as `final` and use the constructor to initialize them. This will make the rules more predictable and easier to reason about.
*   **Validation:** The validation for the rule inputs is currently handled in the UI. This logic should be moved into the `Rule` classes themselves, or to a dedicated validator class.
*   **Clarity:** The `apply` methods are generally clear, but some of the more complex rules could benefit from being broken down into smaller, private methods.

---
## 16. `lib/logic/rules/rule_stack.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Immutability:** The `RuleStack` class is a data model and should be immutable. Declare its fields as `final` and use the constructor to initialize them.
*   **Serialization:** The `toJson` and `fromJson` methods are well-defined.
*   **Clarity:** The `apply` method is clear and concise. No major refactoring is needed here.
*   **Null Safety:** The code has a potential null access issue (`r.toJson()`). Use null-safe operators (`?.` or `!`) to make the code more robust.

---
## 17. Test Files

This section covers all the test files in the `test/` directory.

Files included:
*   `file_size_rule_test.dart`
*   `path_segment_rule_test.dart`
*   `root_directory_entry_test.dart`
*   `simple_regex_rule_test.dart`

### Suggestions:

*   **Test Coverage:** The current tests cover the basic functionality of the rules. However, the test suite should be expanded to include more edge cases, such as invalid inputs, empty files, and files with special characters in their names.
*   **Test Organization:** The tests are currently organized by rule. Consider creating a more structured test suite with a clear separation between unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests.
*   **Code Duplication:** There is some duplicated code in the test setup. Consider creating a test helper file with common setup and teardown logic.
